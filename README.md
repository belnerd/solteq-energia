## Installing and running the project

After cloning install the packages (this will also install http-server for the client)
``` npm install ```

To run the server and client
``` npm start ```

- The client should be now running at http://localhost:8080
- The server should now respond at http://localhost:3000

If you do not want to install http-server (if you already have something similar installed)
you can just install and run the server.
``` cd server
 npm install
 npm run start
 ```
